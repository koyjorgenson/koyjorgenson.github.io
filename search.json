    "section": "",
    "text": "MLB baseball has been around for centuries. Over the years there have been great teams throughout each generation with certain dynasties taking over. The New York Yankees have been one of those teams over the years who have just signed amazing players that have helped them win so many championships. Along with that, they played very consistently over the span of the last century.\nNow looking at the modern generation one can ponder whether the Yankees have still dominated in the 2000s or whether there has been a more consistent organization over the past 23 years.\nIn fact, right now the MLB has the best players and the most difficult league that it has ever had.\nBaseball Reference gives us data from every organization ever and the MLB total wins. Although simplifying this only to the years 2000 to 2023 so it is easier to understand.\nLooking at the MLB now, do we have a different successful organization let’s look?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nteamwins &lt;- read_csv(\"teamwins.csv\")\nLongData &lt;- read_csv(\"teamwinslong.csv\")\n\nSelectedData &lt;-

Below you’ll find that there are a few candidates that are likely to break the record. One being the great sharpshooter Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers and Damian Lillard from the Milwaukee Bucks.

Although we don’t know how long he is going to play we do know that although his record is almost unreachable there are a few candidates in the league that could potentially break his record."
